#RSS Reader for Ruby on Rails

The application I share here is the implementation of a RSS reader and aggregator. This allows the user to add 
feed sources, retrieve the feed entries, and also add some filters for the feeds (e.g. Full text RSS filter).
The functionality is based in FeedZirra and the user interface is based on the sample application explained in the excellent Rails tutorial by Michael Hartl.
